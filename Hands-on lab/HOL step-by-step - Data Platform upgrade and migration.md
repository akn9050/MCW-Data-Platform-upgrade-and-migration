# Data Platform upgrade and migration hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement a proof of concept (POC) for conducting a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server. You evaluate the dependent applications and reports that need to be updated and come up with a migration plan. Also, you help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server features to improve performance and resiliency and perform a migration from an old version of SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to design and build a database migration plan and implement any required application changes associated with changing database technologies.

## Overview

World Wide Importers (WWI) has experienced significant growth in the last few years. In addition to predictable growth, they’ve had a substantial amount of growth in the data they store in their data warehouse. Their data warehouse is starting to show its age, slowing down during extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations and during critical queries. The data warehouse is running on SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition.

The WWI CIO has recently read about new performance enhancements of Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2017. She is excited about the potential performance improvements related to clustered ColumnStore indexes. She is also hoping that table compression can improve performance and backup times.

WWI is concerned about upgrading their database to Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2017. The data warehouse has been successful for a long time. As it has grown, it has filled with data, stored procedures, views, and security. WWI wants assurance that if it moves its data store, it won’t run into any incompatibilities with the storage engine of Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2017.

WWI’s CIO would like a POC of a data warehouse move and proof that the new technology can help ETL and query performance.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram is divided into Microsoft Azure, and On Premises. Microsoft Azure includes SQL Server 2017 in a VM as an Always On Secondary, and Azure SQL Stretch Database to extend the audit table to Azure. On Premise includes the following elements: API App for vendor connections; Web App for Internet Sales Transactions; ASP.NET Core App for inventory management; SQL Server 2017 OLTP for Always On and JSON store; SSRS 2017 for Reporting of OLTP, Data Warehouse, and Cubes; SSIS 2017 for a Data Warehouse Load; Excel for reporting; SQL Server 2017 Enterprise for a Data Warehouse; and SSAS 2017 for a Data Warehouse. ](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The solution begins with using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to perform an assessment to see what potentials issues need to be addressed in upgrading the database to SQL Server 2017 or Azure SQL Database. After correcting any issues, the SQL Server 2008 database is migrated to Azure SQL Database, using the Azure Database Migration Service. Two features of Azure SQL Database, Table Compression and ColumnStore Index, will be applied to demonstrate value and performance improvements from the upgrade. For the ColumnStore Index, a new table based on the existing FactResellerSales table will be created, and a ColumnStore index applied. Next, the Oracle XE database supporting the application will be migrated to an on-premises SQL Server 2017 Enterprise instance using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) 7.x for Oracle. Once the Oracle database has been migrated, the Northwind MVC application will be updated, so it targets SQL Server 2017 instead of Oracle. The entity models are updated against SQL Server, and code updates are made to use the new Entity Framework context based on SQL Server. Corrections to stored procedures are made due to differences in how stored procedures are accessed in Oracle versus SQL Server. Azure SQL Stretch Database will be used to extend the audit log table to Azure, helping to prevent the recurrence of a system crash caused by the audit log table filling up.

## Requirements

## Exercise 3: Post upgrade enhancement

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will demonstrate value from the upgrade by enabling the Table Compression and ColumnStore Index features of Azure SQL Database.

### Task 1: Table compression

1. In SSMS on the SqlServer2008 VM, and connect to your Azure SQL Database.

2. Open a new query window by selecting **New Query** from the toolbar.

    ![The New Query icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-new-query.png "SSMS New Query")

3. Copy the script below, and paste it into the query window:

    ```sql
    USE [WorldWideImporters]

    -- Get the Size of the FactInternetSales table
    SELECT
    t.Name AS TableName,
    p.rows AS RowCounts,
    CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
    FROM sys.tables t
    INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
    INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
    INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
    WHERE t.Name = 'FactInternetSales'
    GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
    GO
    ```

4. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query to retrieve the size of the `FactInternetSales` table.

    ![The Execute icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-execute-query.png "Select Execute")

5. In the results pane, note the size of the `FactInternetSales` table.

    ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the uncompressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-uncompressed-size.png "Query results")

6. In the Object Explorer, expand Databases, WorldWideImporters, and Tables.

    ![Databases is highlighted in Object Explorer, WorldWideImporters is highlighted below that, and then Tables is highlighted below that.](./media/ssms-object-explorer-tables.png "Select Tables")

7. Right-click the `FactInternetSales` table, select the **Storage** context menu, and then select **Manage Compression** from the fly-out menu.

    ![The FactInternetSales table is selected on the left, Storage is selected and highlighted in the submenu, and Manage Compression is highlighted on the right.](./media/ssms-table-storage-context-menu.png "Select Manage Compression")

8. On the Welcome page of the Data Compression Wizard, select **Next**.

9. On the Select Compression Type page, select **Row** from the Compression Type drop down, and select **Next**.

    ![The Row compression type is highlighted on the Select Compression Type screen of the Data Compression Wizard.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-compression-type-row.png "Data Compression Wizard Select Compression Type")

10. On the Select an Output Option page, select **Run immediately**, and then select **Finish >>|**.

    ![Run immediately is highlighted on the Select an Output Option screen of the Data Compression Wizard.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-output-row-compression.png "Data Compression Wizard Select an Output Option")

11. Select **Finish** on the Summary page.

    ![The Summary screen of the Data Compression Wizard is displayed.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-summary-row-compression.png "Data Compression Wizard Summary")

12. Close the Data Compression Wizard, and rerun the query to get the size of the `FactInternetSales` table, noting the reduced size of the table.

    ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the row compressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-row-compression-size.png "Query results")

13. Now, repeat steps 7 - 12 above, this time setting the Compression type to Page.

    ![The Page compression type is highlighted on the Select Compression Type screen of the Data Compression Wizard.](media/ssms-data-compression-wizard-compression-type-page.png "Data Compression Wizard Select Compression Type")

14. Once again, observe the table size in the results pane, and compare it to the values noted for the uncompressed table and with Row compression applied.

    ![In the SSMS results pane, the size of the page compressed FactInternetSales table is highlighted.](media/ssms-query-results-factinternetsales-page-compression-size.png "Query results")

15. Both Row and Page compression reduce the size of the table, but Page compression provides the greatest reduction in this case. Compression decreases the load on the Disk I/O subsystem, while increasing the load on the CPU. Since most data warehouse workloads are heavily disk bound, and often have low CPU usage, compression can be a great way to improve performance.

### Task 2: Clustered ColumnStore index

In this task, you will create a new table based on the existing `FactResellerSales` table and apply a ColumnStore index.

1. In SSMS, ensure you are connected to the Azure SQL Database instance.

2. Open a new query window by selecting **New Query** from the toolbar.

    ![The New Query icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-new-query.png "SSMS New Query")

3. Copy the script below, and paste it into the query window:

    ```sql
    USE WorldWideImporters

    SELECT *
    INTO ColumnStore_FactResellerSales
    FROM FactResellerSales
    GO
    ```

4. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query, and create a new table named `ColumnStore_FactResellerSales`, populated with data from the `FactResellerSales` table.

    ![The Execute icon is highlighted on the SSMS toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-execute-query.png "Select Execute")

5. Select **New Query** in the toolbar again, and paste the following query into the new query window. The query contains multiple parts; one to get the size of the `ColumnStore_FactResellerSales` table, a second to create a clustered ColumnStore index on the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table, and then the size query is repeated to get the size after adding the clustered ColumnStore index.

    ```sql
    USE [WorldWideImporters]

    -- Get the Size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
    SELECT
    t.Name AS TableName,
    p.rows AS RowCounts,
    CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
    FROM sys.tables t
    INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
    INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
    INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
    WHERE t.Name = 'ColumnStore_FactResellerSales'
    GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
    GO

    -- Create a clustered columnstore index on the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
    CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX [cci_FactResllerSales]
    ON [dbo].[ColumnStore_FactResellerSales]
    GO

    -- Get the Size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table
    SELECT
    t.Name AS TableName,
    p.rows AS RowCounts,
    CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Size_MB
    FROM sys.tables t
    INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id
    INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p.index_id
    INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
    WHERE t.Name = 'ColumnStore_FactResellerSales'
    GROUP BY t.Name, p.Rows
    GO
    ```

6. Select **Execute** on the toolbar to run the query.

7. In the query results, observe the `Size_MB` value of the table before and after the creation of the clustered ColumnStore index. The first value is the size before the index was created, and the second value is the size after the ColumnStore index was created.

    ![The SSMS results pane is displayed, with the size of the ColumnStore_FactResellerSales table highlighted both before and after the creation of the clustered ColumnStore index.](media/ssms-query-results-columnstore-factresellersales-size.png "ColumnStore_FactResellerSales size query results")

8. Create a new query window by selecting **New Query** from the toolbar, and select **Include Actual Execution Plan** by selecting its button in the toolbar.

    ![The Include Actual Execution Plan icon is highlighted on the New Query the toolbar.](./media/ssms-toolbar-include-actual-execution-plan.png "Select the Include Actual Execution Plan")

9. Paste the queries below into the new query window, and select **Execute** on the toolbar:

    ```sql
    SELECT productkey, salesamount
    FROM ColumnStore_FactResellerSales

    SELECT productkey, salesamount
    FROM FactResellerSales
    ```

10. In the Results pane, select the **Execution Plan** tab. Check the (relative to the batch) percentage value of the two queries and compare them.

    ![The Execution Plan tab is highlighted in the Results pane, 6% is highlighted for Query 1, and 94% is highlighted for Query 2.](./media/ssms-query-results-execution-plan-columnstore-index.png "Compare the two queries")

11. Run the same queries again, but this time set statistics IO on in the query by adding the following to the top of the query window:

    ```sql
    SET STATISTICS IO ON
    GO
    ```

12. Your query should look like:

    ![The query includes the above information at the top.](./media/ssms-query-statistics-io.png "Set stastics IO")

13. Select **Execute** from the toolbar to run the query.

14. Statistics IO reports on the amount of logical pages that are read in order to return the query results. Select the **Messages** tab of the Results pane, and compare two numbers, logical reads and lob logical reads. You should see a significant drop in total number of logical reads on the columns store table.

    ![Various information is highlighted on the Messages tab of the Results pane.](./media/ssms-query-results-messages-stastics-io.png "Compare the information")

15. You are now down with the SqlServer2008 VM.

    ![The NW database is highlighted and checked in the Filter objects dialog. The System database is checked, and all others are unchecked.](media/ssms-filter-objects.png "SSMA Filter objects")

8. In the Output window, you will see a message that the connection was established successfully, similar to the following:

    ![The successful connection message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-connect-to-oracle-success.png "View the successful connection message")

9. Under Oracle Metadata Explorer, expand the localhost node, Schemas, and confirm you can see the NW schema, which will be the source for the migration.

    ![The NW schema is highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-oracle-metadata-explorer-nw.png "Confirm the NW schema")

10. Next, select **Connect to SQL Server** from the toolbar, to add your SQL 2017 connection.

    ![Connect to SQL Server is highlighted on the toolbar.](./media/ssma-toolbar-connect-to-sql-server.png "Select Connect to SQL Server")

11. In the connect to SQL Server dialog, provide the following:

    - **Server name**: Enter the IP address of your SqlServer2017 VM. You can get this from the Azure portal by navigating to your VM's blade, and looking at the Essentials area.

    ![The IP address of your SqlServer2017 VM is highlighted in the Essentials area of your VM's blade in the Azure portal.](./media/azure-sql-database-public-ip-address.png "Enter the IP address ")

    - **Server port**: Leave set to [default].
    - **Database**: Enter Northwind.
    - **Authentication**: Set to Windows Authentication.

    ![The information above is entered in the Connect to SQL Server dialog box, and Connect is selected at the bottom.](./media/ssma-connect-to-sql-server.png "Specify the settings")

12. Select **Connect**.

13. You will see a success message in the output window.

    ![The successful connection message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-connect-to-sql-server-success.png "View the successful connection message")

14. In the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, expand the server node, then Databases. You should see Northwind listed.

    ![Northwind is highlighted under Databases in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind.png "Verify the Northwind listing")

15. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, check the box next to NW, expand the NW database, and uncheck **Packages**. Next, select NW to make sure it is selected in the tree.

    ![The NW schema is selected and highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-oracle-metadata-explorer-nw-selected.png "Confirm the NW schema")

    ![Northwind is selected and highlighted under Databases in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind-selected.png "Select Northwind")

17. In the SSMA toolbar, select **Convert Schema**. There is a bug in SSMA which prevents this button to being properly enabled, so if the button is disabled, you can select the NW node in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, which should cause the Convert Schema button to become enabled. You can also right-click on the NW database in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, and select Convert Schema if that does not work.

    ![Convert Schema is highlighted on the SSMA toolbar.](./media/ssma-toolbar-convert-schema.png "Select Convert Schema")

18. After about a minute the conversion should have completed.

19. In the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, observe that new schema objects have been added. For example, under Northwind, Schemas, NW, Tables you should see the tables from the Oracle database.

    ![NW is selected in the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, and tables from the Oracle database are visible below that.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-nw-tables.png "Observe new schema objects")

20. In the output pane, you will notice a message that the conversion finished with 1 error, and 21 warnings.

    ![The conversion message is highlighted in the Output window.](./media/ssma-convert-schema-output.png "View the conversion message")

21. To view the errors, select the **Error List** at the bottom of the SSMA screen.

    ![Errors List is highlighted at the bottom of the SSMA screen.](./media/ssma-error-list.png "Select Errors List")

22. Select **Warnings** to hide the warnings, and leave only Errors displayed.

    ![The Warnings notification is highlighted in the Errors List.](./media/ssma-warnings.png "Warning tab")

23. Double-click on the error listed. This will display the Table in both Oracle and SQL Server that is causing the error, `EMPLOYEETERRITORIES`. Notice the Oracle table lists `EMPLOYEEID` with a data type of `NUMBER`, while SQL Server is expecting a data type of `float(53)`.

    ![NUMBER and float(53) are highlighted under Data Type, and EMPLOYEEID is selected in the split-screen views of the Table tab for Oracle and SQL Server.](./media/ssma-data-type-error.png "View the information")

24. Look at the table definition for the table on the Oracle side.

25. To change the data type, select the **Type Mapping** tab, select the row with source type of number, and select **Edit**.

    ![The Type Mapping tab is highlighted, and below that, the row with source type of number is highlighted, and Edit is highlighted on the right.](./media/ssma-source-type-mapping-number-edit.png "Change the data type")

26. In the Edit Type Mapping dialog, set the Target type to **numeric(precision, scale)**, set the Precision to **10**, and select **OK**.

    ![The information above is entered in the Edit Type Mapping dialog box, and OK is selected at the bottom.](./media/ssma-source-type-mapping-edit-type-mapping-number.png "Specify the settings")

27. Select **Apply** on the Type mapping tab.

    ![The row with source type of number is highlighted on the Type Mapping tab, and Apply is highlighted at the bottom.](./media/ssma-source-type-mapping-number-edit-apply.png "Select Apply")

28. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, right-click the `EMPLOYEETERRITORIES` table, and select **Convert Schema**.

    ![Convert Schema is highlighted in the submenu of the EMPLOYEETERRITORIES table in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-table-convert-schema.png "Select Convert Schema")

29. When prompted that the target exists, select **Overwrite**.

    ![Overwrite is selected and highlighted in the Target Exists prompt.](./media/ssma-table-convert-schema-overwrite.png "Select Overwrite")

30. Notice the error is now gone from the Error List.

31. We are going to fix another data type conversion issue now, which will otherwise appear when we attempt to migrate the data.

32. Select the `ORDER_DETAILS` table in the Oracle Metadata Explorer.

    ![The ORDER_DETAILS table is selected and highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-oracle-metadata-explorer-order-details.png "Select the ORDER_DETAILS table ")

33. Next, you are going to convert the type associated with the `DISCOUNT` column, `FLOAT(23)` to a `numeric(10, 0)`, similar to what you did for the `EMPLOYEETERRITORIES` table.

34. Select the **Type Mapping** tab, then select `float[*..53]` from the Source Type list, and select **Edit**.

    ![The row with source type of float\[\*..53\] is selected and highlighted on the Type Mapping tab, and Edit is highlighted on the right.](./media/ssma-type-mapping-float-edit.png "Edit float[*..53]")

35. In the Edit Type Mapping dialog, change the Target type to `numeric(precision, scale)`, and set the Precision to **10**, then select **OK**.

    ![In the Edit Type Mapping dialog box, numeric(precision, scale) is highlighted under Target type, 10 is highlighted next to Replace with under Precision, and OK is highlighted at the bottom.](./media/ssma-edit-type-mapping-float-to-numeric.png "Change the Target type")

36. Select **Apply** to save the changes to the `ORDER_DETAILS` table.

37. Now, right-click on the `ORDER_DETAILS` table in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, and select **Convert Schema**.

38. When prompted that the target exists, select **Overwrite**.

39. **Optional**: Save the project. This can take a while, and is not necessary to complete the hands-on lab.

40. To apply the resultant schema to the Northwind database in SQL Server, use the SQL Server Metadata Explorer to view the Northwind database. Right-click Northwind, and select **Synchronize with Database**.

    ![Synchronize with Database is highlighted in the submenu of the Northwind database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-synchronize-with-database.png "Select Synchronize with Database")

41. Select **OK** in the Synchronize with the Database dialog.

42. The Synchronize action will result in multiple errors in the Error List, resulting from attempting to add the SSMA assemblies to the Northwind database.

    ![The Errors notification is highlighted at the top of the Errors List window, and the first of multiple errors is selected and highlighted in the Message list.](./media/ssma-synchronize-errors.png "View the errors")

43. These errors are the result of improvements implemented in SQL Server 2017 SQLCLR security model. Specifically, in SQL Server 2017, Microsoft now by default requires that all types of assemblies (SAFE, EXTERNAL_ACCESS, UNSAFE) are authorized for UNSAFE access.

44. For this hands-on lab, you will be adding the assemblies causing the errors to the trusted assembly list, which is synonymous with white-listing the assemblies. To fix these errors, complete the following:

    - Under the **Northwind** database in the SQL Server Metadata Explorer in SSMA, expand **Assemblies**.

    ![Three items are listed below Assemblies, which is highlighted below the Northwind database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind-assemblies.png "Expand Assemblies")

    - Right-click `SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET`, and select **Save as Script**.

    ![Save as Script is highlighted in the submenu for SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET.](./media/ssma-sql-server-metadata-explorer-northwind-assemblies-save-as-script.png "Select Save as Script")

    - Save the script to the local machine.
    - Now, you will need to use SSMS on your SqlServer2017 VM.

        - Open an RDP connection to your SqlServer2017 VM, if one is not already open.
        - Open SSMS 17.
        - Connect to SqlServer2017, by entering **SqlServer2017** into the Server name field, using Windows Authentication, and selecting **Connect**.
        - Expand **Databases**, right-click on **Northwind**, and select **New Query**.
        - Paste the following query into the new query window, but don't execute it until you complete the steps below:

        ```sql
        USE master;
        GO

        DECLARE @clrName nvarchar(4000) = 'SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET'
        DECLARE @asmBin varbinary(max) = [INSERT BINARY];
        DECLARE @hash varbinary(64);

        SELECT @hash = HASHBYTES('SHA2_512', @asmBin);

        EXEC sys.sp_add_trusted_assembly @hash = @hash, @description = @clrName;
        ```

    - Now, return to your Lab VM, and open the saved `SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET.sql` file from the desktop with Notepad.exe.
    - Within the SQL file, locate the line that begins with `CREATE ASSEMBLY`, then locate the word `FROM`. Copy the binary string that appears after `FROM`. This value will span all the way down to the line containing the text `WITH PERMISSION_SET = SAFE`. Be sure not to include any whitespace at the end of the binary value.

        ![The binary string that appears after FROM is highlighted within the SQL file.](./media/assembly-binary-value.png "Copy the binary string")

    - Now, return to SSMS on your SqlServer2017 VM, and replace `INSERT BINARY` with the copied binary value. The line should end with ";" and there should be no whitespace before the ";".
    - Execute the query in SSMS.

45. Repeat step 44, this time for the assembly `SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET`. Make sure to replace the `@clrName` variable in the script with the value "SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET".

46. The SSMA assemblies have now been whitelisted in SQL Server 2017.

47. Return to SSMA on your Lab VM, and rerun the **Synchronize with Database** action on the Northwind database. This will create all the schema objects in the SQL Server Northwind database. There should now be no errors, and the Output pane should show **Synchronization operation is complete**.

48. Now you need to migrate the data.

49. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, select **NW** and from the command bar, select **Migrate Data**.

    ![Migrate Data is highlighted in the command bar of Oracle Metadata Explorer.](./media/ssma-toolbar-migrate-data.png "Select Migrate Data")

50. You will be prompted to re-enter your Oracle credentials for use by the migration connection.

    - Recall the Oracle credentials are:

        - **Server name**: localhost
        - **Server port**: 1521
        - **Oracle SID**: XE
        - **Username**: NW
        - **Password**: oracledemo123

    - The SQL Server credentials are:

        - **Server name**: IP address of your SqlServer2017 VM (obtained in the essentials area of your VM's blade in Azure portal).
        - **Server port**: [default]
        - **Authentication**: Windows Authentication

51. Select **Connect**.

52. After the migration completes, you will be presented with a Data Migration Report, similar to the following:

    ![This is screenshot of an example Data Migration Report.](./media/ssma-data-migration-report.png "View the Data Migration Report")

53. Select **Close** on the migration report.

54. Close SSMA for Oracle.

### Task 2: Modify Application Code

1. In Visual Studio, open the file `DataContext.cs` from the Solution Explorer. You may need to collapse the Data folder, and re-expand it after refreshing if you don't see the file listed

    ![DataContext.cs is highlighted under the Data folder in Solution Explorer.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-data-datacontext.png "Open DataContext.cs")

2. The call to base in the DataContext constructor, at the top of the file, needs to be updated to reflect the correct connection string.

    ![In the DataContext constructor, : base ("name=DataContext") is highlighted.](./media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-data-datacontext-base.png "Update the call to base")

3. Change the line from:

    ```csharp
    : base ("name=DataContext")
    ```

4. To:

    ```csharp
    : base ("name=SqlServerConnectionString")
    ```

5. Save the file.
